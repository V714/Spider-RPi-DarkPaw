# Spider-RPi-DarkPaw

My Raspberry Pi software for AdeeptÂ® DarkPaw Bionic Quadruped Spider Robot Kit due to defective orginal software in my opinion.
Not ready, just started building it :)


To run everything at once - use command:

**python3 camera_stream.py & python3 server.py**


***Don't forget to edit IP in Front end main JS file - you have to put IP of your RaspberryPi***
